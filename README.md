- I have experience writing 'words on a screen' as a technical and UX writer.
- In my free time I like to work on my [travel newsletter](https://awellplacedlog.substack.com/), catch the latest movie at the theatre, binge read fantasy novels, and do various outdoorsy activities like running/rollerblading/climbing/architecture walking-tours.
