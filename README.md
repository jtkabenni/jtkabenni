## Some things about me

- I'm currently working on Visu-NYC, a geo-spacial visualization application that will allow users to make sense of the public data provided by NYC Open Data.
- I'm currently working with a team on an app for climbers to keep track of their climbing goals and map out new routes.
- Learning iOS development with [100 days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).
- I previously professionally wrote 'words on a screen' as a technical and UX writer.
- In my free time I like to work on my [travel newsletter](https://awellplacedlog.substack.com/), catch the latest movie at the theatre, binge read fantasy novels, and do various outdoorsy activities like running/rollerblading/climbing/architecture walking-tours.

## Languages and tools

- Javascript, React, Typescript, Node.js, Express, Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, Next.js, Tailwind
